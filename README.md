This README documents the necessary steps to get Pongagon up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Pongagon is a mobile game that will not only blow your mind, but will also mind your bloww
* Currently there are more versions than times this game has crushed my soul, so there is no definitive versioning

### How do I get set up? ###

* Learn how to yell at a computer to a Jalforian level
* Reach a level of middle management considered as 'J-mo' like
* There are technically no dependencies, but you will be required to cry yourself to sleep at night before this works
* Game Center is the only database required (Possibly something to do with Google Play) however all that is locked up and Apple and Google's respective HQ's
* Don't run tests, the errors will only make you cry
* Shove it in Xcode and debug till your heart gives in
* Enjoy! You deserve it (the bugs) after all of that fucking about

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Contributors know who they are and will be punished accordingly 

### Who do I talk to? ###

* God, if you can bear telling him your sins
